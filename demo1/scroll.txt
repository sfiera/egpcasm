 BY CHRIS COVELL chris_covell@yahoo.ca  This is a little graphic, sound & CPU demonstration for Epoch's Game Pocket Computer.  I'd say this is definitely the FIRST demo to ever be released for this system, since this is such an obscure handheld with only 5 game cartridges ever to be released. Have fun playing around with my demo! General controls: Start to choose options / execute things; Select to exit sub-programs; 1/3 Buttons to dec/increase numbers by 10; 2/4 buttons to dec/increase numbers by 1.  Graphing controls are different: play around with all buttons to change signs/numbers/exponents.  Mini-Notepad extra: press 1 then 2 to clear 1 line.  "BIG" Scroller speed can also be changed by Left/Right while scrolling.  General hint: search around in all sub-programs; you're sure to find hidden functions and useful(?) extra items.
